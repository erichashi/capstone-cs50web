# CS50 Web Capstone

## Teach.me

Teach.me is a social network web application with the aim of sharing and learning new things by writing (like a "Medium"). You can follow / unfollow users and write, edit, like and comment posts.

The project is sufficiently distinct from the other projects because:
1. There is a more friendly UI and UX 
2. there are some other features like popular posts, featured posts
3. Was used CKEditor software to improve posts composing 
4. Was used an Bootstrap design template in the front-end
